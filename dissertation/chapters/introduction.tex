\section{Motivation}
I have encountered a problem that was inspiration for this work during my research in field
of mobile robotics. While my initial focus was directed more towards emergent behaviour in 
robotics and a self organizing systems I have encountered a issue with localization in marine 
robotics. With high cost of internet connection for robots operating far away from land it 
is important to be able to calculate precise position without updating data from internet.
One of issues when working with satellite navigation system is requirement for clock bias
correction, to keep error drift to minimum readouts for both local and satellite clock must
be corrected by predicted bias. In this work I focused on prediction of errors in satellite
clocks as unlike in case of local clock those can be later reused by other people.

\section{Terminology used}
When working with multiple sources distributed across different fields of science a problem of 
differences in notation is encountered. To integrate all of gathered information into a single 
coherent work a single notation must be decided on and all equations should be then translated
into that notation.
Due to author interest in cybernetics and multi agent system a terminology with following 
concepts as base will be used:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item system,
	\item observation,
	\item response,
	\item transfer function,
\end{enumerate}
while in specific context different names may be given to specific parts of that model general
concept will remain unchanged.

\begin{definition}[System]
	A system is a set of elements which interact with each other. It can interact with it 
	environment by gathering observations and sending responses.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Observation]
	An observation is a set of information about a state of an environment or about internal
	system state.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Response]
	Response is set of information returned by a system to environment.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Transfer function]
	Transfer function maps an observation into a response.
\end{definition}
In this worke transfer function will be often refered to by a name more associated with its 
current context. For example in case of predictor systems it will be called hypothesis.
