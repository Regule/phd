\section{Hypothesis}
With the application of modern machine learning algorithms, especially artificial neural networks,
it is possible to predict a clock bias with an error of less than 1 $\mu s$ basing only on
previously measured errors.

\section{Motivation}
I have encountered a problem that was an inspiration for this work during my research in the 
field of mobile robotics.
While my initial focus was directed more towards emergent behavior in robotics and self-organizing 
systems \cite{Gnys2017}\cite{Gnys2019} I have encountered an issue with localization in marine 
robotics \cite{Cabrera-Gamez2014}.
With the high cost of internet connection for robots operating far away from land, 
it is important to be able to calculate precise position without updating data from the internet.
One of the issues when working with a satellite navigation system is a requirement for clock bias
correction, to keep error drift to minimum readouts for both local and satellite clocks must
be corrected by predicted bias.
