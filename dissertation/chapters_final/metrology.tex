\chapter{Time metrology}

The aim of this chapter is to present an issue that will be dealt with in this work.
First, a concept of a theoretical clock will be presented alongside the mathematical tools 
required for its description and behavior modeling.
After describing theoretical clock models attention will be given to the physical implementation
of clock system with a special focus on types of clocks used aboard GPS satellites.
Finally, the current state of the art in GPS clock bias prediction will be presented.
The intention of writing this chapter was that despite clock modeling and frequency analysis being
well-known field readers with computer science might not be familiar with it.
For those well versed in frequency analysis, most of this chapter can be safely skipped with
exception of the last section that focuses on state of the art in GPS clock prediction as it
deals with issues that are more specific do describe in this work.
It is important to understand that this chapter does not provide comprehensive knowledge about
the described field as due to methodology used in the presented work 
that knowledge is not required.
For more information about clock modeling and stability analysis Handbook of Frequency Stability
Analysis is suggested as reading.
