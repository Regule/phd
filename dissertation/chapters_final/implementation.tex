\subsection{SP3 file format}
The original form of the Standard Product 3 format, referred to as SP3-a, was by Benjamin Remondi 
in 1989 \cite{Remondi1989}.
After a few modification it was adopted two years later \cite{Remondi1991}. 
The SP3 format is similar to the original NGS Standard Product 1 format, however it includes
additional information from which the satellite clock corrections are most important in context
of this work.
