In this chapter attention will be given to artificial neural networks (ANN) which are one of most 
popular data processing models in self learning systems \cite{Abiodun2019} \cite{Tran2021}
\cite{Syed2021}. First focus will be given to biological neural networks, that will be reffered 
to as a neural circuits (NC) in order to be consistent with nomenclature \cite{Purves2001} as 
well as to avoid confusion with ANN.  
After that an electrical models of NC will be shortly described and finally a mathematical models
that are used in modern ANN solutions will be discussed. Special attention will be given to 
computational complexity of both running and teaching described ANN models.

\section{Neural circuits in biological systems}
\FloatBarrier
In case of organic systems two kinds of information processing subsystems can be distinguished
\cite{Johnson2016}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item neural system which is low latency localized signal processing system that requires
	both source and sink of signal to be directly connected to it, 
	\item endocrine system which is high latency system that influences whole organism and do 
	not require direct connection to affected cells as information is delivered in form of 
	hormones in blood.
\end{itemize}
While both systems interact witch each other and are important for correct functioning of 
organisms \cite{Schwarz2019} in this work attention will be given only to neural system with
special focus on interneurons that process already collected data.

\subsection{Neural cell as a base of information processing circuit}
\FloatBarrier
At most basic level a neuron is an animal cell which means it must contain all organelle that
are common among those type of cells as well as be able to realize most of metabolic processes.

	\label{fig:neural_cell}
\end{figure}
While all parts of cell are required for its function it is not aim of this work to describe 
cell biology, as such only elements that are directly involved in neurotransmission will be
described in more detail as shown on Figure \ref{fig:neural_cell}.
Soma, also called a cell body, contains nucleus with genetic material and is considered the 
tropic center of a neural cell \cite{Jacobson2017}. From it extend dendrites that increase a 
receptive surface of  the neuron.
At place called axon hillock an single elongated appendix, called axon, protrudes
from a cell body. Its role is to transmit neuron response as a electrical signal into another
cells. In order to correctly carry out this function axon must be protected from environment 
by a myelin sheath. Those sheaths are not integral part of the neuron and are created by a
Schwann cells in peripheral nervous system and by a glial cells in central nervous system.
Area of contact between axon of one nerve cell and dendrites of another is called synapse.
There are two basic types of synapses:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Electrical synapses that are connected with membrane bridges and gap junctions
	that allow direct transmission of electrical impulse between the cells \cite{Connors2017}.
	Those synapses have negligible latency and risk of misfiring.
	Electrical synapses are most commonly found in fish \cite{Yao2014}, however they also appear
	to some degree in mammalian brains \cite{Connors2004}.
	\item Chemical synapses that contain vesicles on presynaptic side and membrane receptors on 
	postsynaptic \cite{Fuster2015}.
	The neurotransmitter released by the action potential is exocytosed and diffuses
	across the synaptic cleft and binds to the specific receptor on the postsynaptic membrane.
	Most of the synapses seen in the mammalian central nervous system are chemical \cite{Boto2019}.
\end{itemize}
