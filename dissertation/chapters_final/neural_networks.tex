\chapter{Neural networks}

In this chapter attention will be given to artificial neural networks (ANN) which are one of most 
popular data processing models in self learning systems \cite{Abiodun2019} \cite{Tran2021}
\cite{Syed2021}. First focus will be given to biological neural networks, that will be referred 
to as a neural circuits (NC) in order to be consistent with nomenclature \cite{Purves2001} as 
well as to avoid confusion with ANN.  
After that an electrical models of NC will be shortly described and finally a mathematical models
that are used in modern ANN solutions will be discussed. Special attention will be given to 
computational complexity of both running and teaching described ANN models.
