Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks have prooven to be a powerfull
prediction algorithm and are used in many areas where data with time series nature 
must be predicted. In this paper it is demonstrated that it can also be used for
prediction of the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite on-board atomic clock bias.
Results of LSTM predictions were compared with a current state of the art in 
low latency GPS clock bias prediction and it was demonstrated that approach proposed
in this work is able to provide better precision of results.
